# Dissertation scripts

I used the scripts in this repository to convert my LaTeX dissertation to a navigable website, which can be viewed [here](https://gregkm.me/dissertation/index.html).

Note that the entire process was quite hacky, and required making substantial changes to the LaTeX source and engrafo, as well as writing these custom scripts,  in order to get things to build and compile happily. A lot of the changes are specific to my dissertation. So, if you embark on a similar journey, just know it will take quite a bit of effort, and probably a lot more of your time than you expect!

Some quick tips to get you started:

- I switched from the `ucbthesis` class to the `book` class because it seems better supported by LaTeXML
- I had to switch all my figures (which were in PDF format) to SVG, and put the path to the SVG in the `\includegraphics` commands
- The `engrafo` docker image referenced in these scripts was generated by the Dockerfile in the customized `engrafo` repository I list here as a submodule
- The `latexml-git` docker image was built by running `docker build -t latexml-git - < Dockerfile-latexml` in this directory

Good luck!
